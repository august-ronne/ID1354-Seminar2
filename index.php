                Painfully Mediocre Recipes, has collected his
                favorite mediocre recipes for you to enjoy.
                Due to a general lack of ambition there are currently
                only two recipes available for our guests, but more
                are on the way!<br><br>
                You can find all our recipes by clicking on 'Recipes'
                in the menu, or if you wish to have a special dish recommended
                to you for each day of the month, you should click on
                Calendar.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your visit.</p>
